Use the entire genome of the organism as the decoy sequence. This can be done by concatenating the genome to the end of the transcriptome you want to index and populating the decoys.txt file with the chromosome names. Detailed instructions on how to prepare this type of decoy sequence is available {here}(https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2019/selective-alignment/) . This scheme provides a more comprehensive set of decoys, but, obviously, requires considerably more memory to build the index.
